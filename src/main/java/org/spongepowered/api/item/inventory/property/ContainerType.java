/**
 * GuiIds are used in a {@link GuiIdProperty} when building a custom {@link Inventory}.
 * The GuiId defines what {@link Container} is displayed on the client side when the
 * custom inventory is opened.
 *
 * <p>When using the default vanilla {@link InventoryArchetype}s the
 * GuiIdProperty is already set, but can be overridden.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sponge will not allow to open a inventory that has the wrong
 * total size for the GuiId. e.g. You can open a 1x9 Grid Inventory as
 * a Dispenser (3x3). But a 2x9 inventory will not work with it.</p>
